Questions 1.2.1: Mystery Output

Imagine you are a detective exploring the mysterious world of C++ output! 
Your mission is to decipher what will be printed to the console when the following C++ code, named "MysteryOutput.cpp," is executed. 
Analyze the code based on the knowledge you've gained from the C++ lessons. What will be the output for each variable?

#include <iostream>
#include <string>

int main() {
    // Fun with C++ output mystery!
    
    // Declare variables
    int x = 5;
    double y = 2.5;
    char ch = 'A';
    std::string message = "Hello, C++!";

    // Output statements
    std::cout << "x: " << x << std::endl;
    std::cout << "y: " << y << std::endl;
    std::cout << "ch: " << ch << std::endl;
    std::cout << "message: " << message << std::endl;

    return 0;
}



Question 1.2.2: Temperature Converter

Prompt the user to enter a temperature in Celsius, and then use a C++ program named "CelsiusToFahrenheitConverter.cpp" to convert the entered temperature to Fahrenheit. 
Ensure to include clear prompts, handle both uppercase and lowercase input, and add comments to describe each section of the program. 
Predict the output when a temperature in Celsius is provided.



Question 1.2.3: Mood-Boosting Chatbox

You're crafting a straightforward chatbot program in C++.
Request the user to input their current mood using a single-character code ('S' for sad). 
No matter what the user writes for the input, the program should output a message specifically designed to uplift the user's mood with their input included.
