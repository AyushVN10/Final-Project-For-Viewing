Question 4.3.1: Pirate's Puzzle Plunder

As the official treasure map designer for a pirate crew, create a map called treasureMap where each location is marked with a unique clue. 
Add clues for places like "Skull Island," "Mermaid Lagoon," and "Cursed Cove." Incorporate a new location, "Hidden Harbor," into the map. 
Arrange the clues in alphabetical order and unveil the secrets hidden within, especially if "Skull Island" is a lurking treasure trove.

You are orchestrating a magical creature convention, and chaos ensues! 
Implement a set named creatureAttendees to manage the attendee IDs for creatures like "Phoenix," "Dragon," "Mermaid," and "Centaur."

b) Dining Preferences Map: Develop a map named diningPreferences to capture the dining preferences of each alien species. Assign preferences such as "Zero-G Noodles" for "Lunar Lepus," "Galactic Gushers" for "Nebula Nymph," and "Celestial Sushi" for "Stellar Squid."
c) New Reservation: A new alien species, "Quantum Quokka," just made a reservation. Add "Quantum Quokka" to the set and assign its dining preference as "Quantum Quinoa."
