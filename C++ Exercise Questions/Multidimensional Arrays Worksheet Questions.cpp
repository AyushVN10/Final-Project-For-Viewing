Question 4.4.1: Sudoku Solver Extravaganza

Imagine you've been recruited by the "Sudoku Superstars" organization to create a mind-bending Sudoku solver in C++.
Your task is to implement a function called solveSudoku that takes a 2D vector representing the Sudoku board as input and returns the solved board. 
Use your knowledge of multidimensional arrays to access and modify individual elements. 
Additionally, demonstrate the use of nested loops to iterate through the entire board and check for a valid solution.



Question 4.4.2: Pixel Power-Up Challenge

You've landed a gig at the "Pixel Power-Up" game studio, and they need your C++ wizardry to implement a 3x3 convolution filter for a grayscale image. 
Create a function named applyConvolutionFilter that takes a 2D array representing the image and applies a predefined filter to enhance pixel intensity. 
Use your multidimensional array skills to access and update pixel values, and showcase the power of nested loops for the convolution process.



Question 4.4.3: The Maze Navigator

Imagine you're in a whimsical maze filled with twists and turns, and your goal is to navigate through it using C++. 
Your position in the maze is represented as a 2D array, where each cell is either an open path ('O') or a wall ('#'). 
You start at the top-left corner (maze[0][0]) and need to reach the bottom-right corner (maze[m-1][n-1]).

Your task is to write a C++ function called navigateMaze that takes the maze as input and returns a boolean indicating whether it's possible to navigate to the destination. 
You can move only down or right, and you cannot move through walls.
