Questions 4.1.1: Element Swap

Description: You are working on an image processing algorithm, and you need to perform a specific operation on an array of pixel values. 
Implement a function swapAdjacentElements that takes an integer array representing pixel values. The function should swap each element with its adjacent element. 
Ensure that you don't go out of bounds while swapping elements. Display the modified array after the swapping operation using a loop. 
Additionally, use the sizeof() function to determine the size of the array dynamically.



Questions 4.1.2: Dynamic Initialization

Description: Assume you are developing a program where the size of an array is not known at compile time but is determined during runtime. 
Implement a function initializeDynamicArray that takes an integer argument representing the size and dynamically allocates memory for an integer array of that size. 
Ensure to initialize the array elements with consecutive integers starting from 1. 
Finally, display the elements of the dynamically allocated array using a loop. Remember to deallocate the memory at the end of the program.



Questions 4.1.3: Positive Transformation Array

Description: Create a beginner-friendly C++ program that transforms an array of integers into a positively charged array. Follow these steps:
  - Prompt the user to enter non-zero integers one by one and store them in an array. Stop accepting data when the user enters zero.
  - Print out the contents of the array.
  - Iterate through the array and transform all negative integers into their positive counterparts (e.g., change -5 to 5).
  - Print out the array contents again, ensuring that all integers are positive.
