Question 2.4.1: Logical Wizardry

Given the variables, int temperature = 28 and bool isSummer = true, create a compound boolean expression using logical operators.
The condition should output "Perfect weather" if the temperature is between 20 and 30 (inclusive) and it's summer. 
Otherwise, it should output "Consider indoor activities." Write the C++ code snippet for this scenario.



Question 2.4.2: Scholarship Eligibility

You are designing a scholarship eligibility check for a university. The eligibility criteria are as follows:

The applicant must be either a current high school student (represented by the boolean variable bool isHighSchoolStudent) or a college freshman (bool isCollegeFreshman).
The applicant's age must be between 17 and 25 (inclusive).
The applicant must not have any previous scholarship (represented by the boolean variable bool hasPreviousScholarship).
Write a C++ if-statement using compound boolean expressions to determine if an applicant is eligible for the scholarship. 
If the applicant is eligible, output "Congratulations! You qualify for the scholarship," otherwise output "Sorry, you do not meet the eligibility criteria." Use appropriate variables and values.



Question 2.4.3: Gym Membership Eligibility

The local Pokemon Gym offers different membership fees based on age and the number of badges trainers have earned. 
Write a C++ program to determine the eligibility and membership fee for trainers applying for gym membership. Here are the conditions:

Trainers must be at least 14 years old to be eligible.
Trainers are rated based on the number of badges they have earned. Use the codes B, S, and G for Bronze, Silver, and Gold badges, respectively.
Membership fees are determined as follows:
- For trainers aged 14-25 (inclusive):
  - Bronze badge holders pay $3.50.
  - Silver badge holders pay $2.50.
  - Gold badge holders pay $1.50.
- For trainers aged 26-40 (inclusive):
  - Bronze badge holders pay $2.50.
  - Silver badge holders pay $1.75.
  - Gold badge holders pay $1.00.
- For trainers aged 41 or older:
  - Bronze, Silver, and Gold badge holders pay $1.00.
Write a C++ program that takes the trainer's age and badge code as input and outputs the eligibility status and the corresponding membership fee.

Ensure to check the eligibility before calculating the membership fee. If a trainer is not eligible, output a message indicating ineligibility.

Use compound boolean expressions to implement the conditions for determining eligibility and membership fees.
