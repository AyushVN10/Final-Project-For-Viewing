Question 2.2.1: Ticket Pricing Wonderland

You're designing a ticket pricing system for an amusement park based on age and ride preferences. Implement a nested conditional statement to determine the ticket price:

If the age is 12 or below,
 - Check if the child prefers roller coasters.
   - If yes, display "Child Roller Coaster Enthusiast - $10."
   - If no, display "Child, but not into roller coasters - $8."
If the age is 15, display "Teen Ticket - $12."
If the age is 18 or above,
 - Check if the person is a thrill-seeker.
   - If yes, display "Adult Thrill-Seeker - $15."
   - If no, display "Regular Adult - $10."



Question 2.2.2: Gadget Shipping Validator

You're developing a program called "Gadget Shipping Validator" for an electronics store. 
The application prompts users to input details about a gadget they want to ship, including its weight in kilograms and dimensions in cubic centimeters. 
Implement the following conditions:

- If the gadget's weight is over 15 kilograms, inform the user that the gadget is too heavy for standard shipping.
- If the dimensions exceed 50,000 cubic centimeters, notify the user that the gadget is too large for standard shipping.
- If both conditions are met, display a message indicating that the gadget is both too heavy and too large for standard shipping.
- If the gadget meets neither condition, reassure the user that their gadget is eligible for standard shipping.
- This question challenges your ability to apply nested conditional statements to evaluate diverse criteria and provide tailored feedback based on user inputs.



Question 2.2.3: Library Book Recommender

You are developing a program for a library that recommends books to users based on their reading preferences. 
Prompt the user for information on their preferred genre and whether they enjoy fiction or non-fiction. 
Implement the following conditions using nested conditional statements:

If the user prefers "Mystery," inquire if they like fiction.
  - If they enjoy fiction, recommend a popular mystery novel.
  - If they prefer non-fiction, suggest a true crime or investigative journalism book.
  
If the user leans toward "Science Fiction," ask if they have a preference for fiction.
  - If they enjoy fiction, recommend a captivating sci-fi or fantasy novel.
  - If they prefer non-fiction, suggest a science-related or mythology exploration book.
  
If the user selects "Historical," inquire about their interest in fiction.
  - If they enjoy fiction, recommend a well-researched historical novel.
  - If they prefer non-fiction, suggest a biography or historical documentation.
