Question 3.2.1: The Loop Maze Code Challenge

You find yourself trapped in a mysterious Loop Maze and must write a C++ program to escape using nested for loops. 
Code your way through the maze by implementing nested loops. 
In this coding quest, each iteration of the outer loop should represent a move in the maze, and the inner loop's magic helps you overcome obstacles. 
Utilize the "break" statement to exit the loops when you successfully navigate the maze and reach freedom.



Question 3.2.2: Kingdom of For Loop Adventures

Welcome to the enchanted Kingdom of For Loop Adventures! Craft a C++ program using for loops and nested loops to create a captivating menu-driven quest. 
Imagine a world where adventurers embark on epic journeys, and each iteration of the loops unfolds a new chapter in their quests.
Harness the power of for loops to guide heroes through the kingdom, and use the "break" statement to gracefully conclude their adventures.



Question 3.2.3: Pattern Party with For Loops

It's time to throw a Pattern Party using for loops in C++! Imagine you're organizing the coolest pattern-based extravaganza. 
Describe the pattern you want to showcase and provide the code that brings it to life with a for loop. 
Share a creative scenario where each loop iteration contributes to the vibrant atmosphere of the party. 
Wrap it up with the "else" keyword, signaling the end of a fantastic coding fiesta!
