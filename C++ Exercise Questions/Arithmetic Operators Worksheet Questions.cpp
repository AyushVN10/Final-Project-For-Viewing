Questions 1.3.1: Code Analysis and Output Prediction

Consider the following code snippet:

int x = 7, y = 3, z;
z = x % y + 4 * (x - y);
std::cout << "Result: " << z;

a. Explain the order of execution for the arithmetic operations in the expression z = x % y + 4 * (x - y).

b. Predict and write the output that will be displayed on the console when this code is executed.



Questions 1.3.2: Variable Modification and Output

In the main function, initialize two variables, length, and width, with values 8 and 5, respectively. 
Calculate and assign the area of a rectangle to a variable named area using the formula area = length * width. 
Additionally, calculate and assign the remainder of length divided by width to a variable named remainder using the modulus operator. 
Then, output both the area and remainder with informative messages using std::court.



Questions 1.3.3: Interactive Calculation

Write a program that takes user input for the base and height of a triangle. 
Calculate and output the area of the triangle using the formula area = 0.5 * base * height. 
Ensure that the program prompts the user for input, and the output is formatted with a clear message.
Assume that the user will always enter valid numerical values.
