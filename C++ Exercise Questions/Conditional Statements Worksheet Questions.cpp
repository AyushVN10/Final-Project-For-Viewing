Question 2.1.1: Artistic Code Blocks

Imagine you are designing a program to create ASCII art based on user input. Use C++ 'if' statements to achieve the following:

a) If the user enters 'circle,' print a circle ASCII art.
b) If the user enters 'square,' print a square ASCII art.
c) If the user enters anything else, display a message saying, "Sorry, that shape is not supported."



Question 2.1.2: C++ Movie Ticket Pricing

You are crafting a program to determine movie ticket prices based on different age groups. The pricing scheme is as follows:

Age Range	Ticket Price ($)
0 – 12	5.00
13 – 17	7.50
18 – 59	10.00
60 or more	8.00
Develop a C++ program named movie_ticket_pricing that accomplishes the following tasks:

Prompt the user to enter their age.
Employ conditional statements to calculate and display the appropriate ticket price based on their age.
Output the determined ticket price for the user to see.



Questions 2.1.3: Adventure Game Decision Maker

You are designing an interactive text-based adventure game in C++. 
As the protagonist traverses through different scenarios, the game presents decision points.
Each decision influences the outcome of the adventure. Use the concepts from the lesson to create a decision-making program:

a) Define two variables representing the protagonist's health and courage.
b) Set up an "if" statement to check the health level:
  - If health is above 75, output a message encouraging the protagonist to face challenges bravely.
  - If health is between 50 and 75, provide a warning about potential dangers ahead.
  - If health is below 50, advise the protagonist to prioritize healing before facing further challenges.
c) Incorporate an "else if" statement based on the courage level:
  - If courage is high, encourage the protagonist to take bold actions.
  - If courage is moderate, suggest considering risks before making decisions.
  - If courage is low, recommend a cautious approach to avoid potential pitfalls.
d) Output messages based on both health and courage conditions to guide the protagonist in their adventure.
