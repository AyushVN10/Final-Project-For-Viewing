Question 3.3.1: Virtual Pet Adoption Center

You are creating a virtual pet adoption center where users can adopt unique virtual pets. 
Design a C++ program with a function named adoptVirtualPet that takes two parameters: petName (string) and petType (string). 
The function should simulate the adoption process and print a message like: "Congratulations! You've adopted a [petType] named [petName]". 
In your main function, demonstrate calling this function with various virtual pet names and types to showcase the versatility of functions in managing different scenarios.



Question 3.3.2: Palindrome Check

Develop a C++ function named isDynamicPalindrome that takes a string as a parameter and returns a boolean indicating whether the string is a dynamic palindrome. 
In a dynamic palindrome, characters are symmetrically swapped from the center outwards. 
For example, "abcdeedcba" is a dynamic palindrome. Test your function with different strings in your main function.



Question 3.3.3: Gravitational Pull Calculator

Implement a C++ function named calculateGravitationalPull that takes two parameters: mass (m in kg) and distance from the center (r in m). 
Use these parameters in a formula to calculate gravitational pull. 
Create a program that utilizes this function to calculate the gravitational pull for a given mass at varying distances from 1 m to 50 m, in increments of 5. 
Allow the user to input the mass for experimentation.
