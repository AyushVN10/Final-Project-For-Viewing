Questions 1.1.1: Variable Challenge

Imagine you're working on a program to manage a school's information system. Declare variables to store the following information using appropriate data types:

Number of students in a class
Average height of students (in meters)
The first letter of the teacher's last name
Whether the class has a project (true/false)
The name of the school (use a std::string)
Make sure that you follow the rules for naming variables in C++.



Question 1.1.2: Numeric Puzzle

Create a C++ program to solve a numeric puzzle. Declare three variables a, b, and c with initial values 5, 2, and 3, respectively. 
Use these variables to calculate and print the result of the expression a * b + c / a - b. 
Ensure that each step of the calculation has comments describing what is happening.



Question 1.1.3: Coding Results

In a prestigious coding competition, participants are awarded different grades based on their performance. 
Your task is to implement a C++ program that uses namespaces to represent the grades. Create a variable named "grade" and assign it values based on the following criteria:

If a participant secured the first position, set the grade to reflect a perfect average of 100.
If a participant secured the second position, set the grade to reflect an outstanding average of 98.
If a participant secured the third position, set the grade to reflect an excellent average of 95.
For all other positions, set the grade to a default value of 90.

Now, print out the grade using the appropriate namespace based on the participant's position. Make sure to showcase the use of namespaces to avoid any conflicts in variable names.
