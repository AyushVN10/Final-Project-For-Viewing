Question 4.5.1: Sorting and Searching in Vectors

You have a vector named numbers with the following elements: {5, 2, 8, 1, 7, 3, 6, 4}. Using the knowledge gained from the notes on C++ Standard Library Algorithms, perform the following tasks:
a) Sort the vector in ascending order.
b) Search for the element '7' in the sorted vector using the std::binary_search algorithm. Print whether the element is found or not.
c) Reverse the vector.
d) Find the minimum and maximum elements in the reversed vector using the std::min_element and std::max_element algorithms.



Question 4.5.2: Matrix Operations

Consider the 2D vector (matrix) named "matrix":
{
    {1, 2, 3},
    {4, 5, 6},
    {7, 8, 9}
}
Perform the following operations:
a) Print the original matrix.
b) Modify the element at row 0, column 1 to have the value '10'.
c) Add a new row to the matrix with elements {11, 12, 13}.
d) Iterate through the modified matrix and print each element.



Question 4.5.3: Manipulating Sets

You have a set named mySet with the elements {5, 2, 8, 3}. Use the knowledge from the notes on sets and algorithms:
a) Insert the elements 6 and 1 into the set.
b) Check if the element '4' is present in the set. Print the result.
c) Remove the element '2' from the set.
d) Display the elements of the set after the modifications in ascending order.
Ensure that the questions involve the application of algorithms mentioned in the C++ Standard Library and the manipulation of collections discussed in the notes.
