Question 3.1.1: Dynamic Counter

In your C++ program, create a while loop that dynamically adjusts its condition based on user input. 
Prompt the user to enter a positive integer value, and then utilize a while loop to print the squares of numbers from 1 to the entered value. 
Implement a break statement to terminate the loop if the squared value exceeds 50. 
Ensure that the loop adheres to the principles of proper initialization, condition, and iteration.



Question 3.1.2: The Dungeon Explorer

Imagine creating a simple text-based dungeon explorer game.
Set up a scenario where the player finds themselves in a mysterious dungeon with multiple rooms. Inside each room, the player encounters a challenge represented by a random number (e.g., 1 to 5). 
Prompt the player to enter their chosen difficulty level (1 to 5) before entering the dungeon.
Implement a do-while loop that continues until the player decides to exit voluntarily. 
In each iteration of the loop, generate a random challenge difficulty for the current room. 
The player must then input their skill level, and the program should compare the player's skill level with the challenge difficulty.
If the player's skill level is greater or equal to the challenge difficulty, print a success message and prompt them to proceed to the next room.
If not, inform the player of their defeat and ask if they want to try the same room again. Use the "do-while" loop to ensure the player gets at least one chance to overcome each challenge.
Include an option for the player to exit the dungeon voluntarily, breaking out of the loop. Use the "else" statement to print a victory message when the player completes all the rooms.



Question 3.1.3: Countdown to Ignition

Develop a C++ program to simulate a countdown for a rocket launch. 
Initialize a variable to represent the countdown value (e.g., 10). 
Use a while loop to print the current countdown value in each iteration. 
Implement a "break" statement to exit the loop when the countdown reaches zero. 
Additionally, add an "else" statement to print a message signaling the ignition of the rocket after the loop concludes. 
Ensure the loop stops if the countdown somehow becomes negative to prevent indefinite execution.
