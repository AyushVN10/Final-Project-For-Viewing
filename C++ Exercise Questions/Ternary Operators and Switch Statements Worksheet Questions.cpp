Question 2.3.1: Ternary Twist

You are tasked with implementing a program that determines whether a given year is a leap year or not. 
Create a program that uses the ternary operator to assign the result to a string variable named leapYearStatus. 
Explain the conditions for a leap year and demonstrate how the ternary operator simplifies the code compared to an if-else statement.



Question 2.3.2: Switch Showdown

Imagine you are developing a simple calculator program in C++ that performs basic arithmetic operations based on user input. 
Design the program using a switch statement to handle the different operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division). 
Discuss the advantages of using a switch statement in this context, and provide a clear example illustrating the use of the switch statement for calculator operations.



Question 2.3.3: Day Decoder

Create a C++ program that prompts the user to enter a day of the week as an integer (1-7). 
Use a switch statement to determine the day's name and whether it is a weekday or weekend day. 
Additionally, employ the ternary operator to decide and display a message indicating if the day's number is even or odd.
Provide comments in your code to explain the logic behind each decision and ensure adherence to the concepts covered in the provided notes.
